                <h2>Book Title:The power of subconscious mind</h2>
                <p>Author: Dr Joseph Murphy</p>
                <p>Price: $149</p>
                <p>Description: It is a fascinating read because unlike most self-help or self discovery books, which talk about how to shape your life or decisions, this book takes a step back and goes deeper into your subconscious mind and details how everything between your conscious and unconscious mind is interconnected.</p>
                <p>Author Information:Murphy was born in Ireland, the son of a private boy's school headmaster and raised a Roman Catholic. He studied for the priesthood and joined the Jesuits. In his twenties, an experience with healing prayer led him to leave the Jesuits and move to the United States, where he became a pharmacist in New York (having a degree in chemistry by that time). Here he attended the Church of the Healing Christ (part of the Church of Divine Science), where Emmet Fox had become minister in 1931.

                    In the mid 1940s, he moved to Los Angeles, where he met Religious Science founder Ernest Holmes, and was ordained into Religious Science by Holmes in 1946, thereafter teaching at the Institute of Religious Science.</p>
                <p>Reviews: Finally, my crochet bookmark is set aside as I bid adieu to this beautiful book that used to rest beside my pillow. Now, it's finding its way to my beloved ones who need its wisdom most.

                    I'm absolutely in love and satisfaction as I read it at a snail's pace. Because this little piece touches on every facet of life from dealing with physical, mental, and financial, to marriage and ageing, affirming all the nicest things about life and bringing positivity into it.
                    
                    I'm truly impressed with the way he narrated at the beginning of the book: 'A magnetized piece of iron will lift about 12 times its weight. But if you demagnetize this same piece of iron, it will not even lift a feather. Similarly, magnetized people are full of confidence and faith. They know they are born to succeed and win.'
                    
                    Also, I was particularly drawn to his exploration of the art of ageing gracefully, aptly titled, 'How to Stay Young in Spirit Forever.'</p>
