                <h2>Book Title:May Be You Should Talk To Someone</h2>
                      <p>Author: Lori Gottlieb</p>
                      <p>Price: $399</p>
                      <p>Description: The honesty and raw vulnerability of the author makes this book stand out. The best part about this book for me is that it is not laden with cheesy, sappy, unactionable life advice. The universal human dilemmas and humanity evoked in Maybe You Should Talk To Someone is resonating for all readers.</p>

                      <p>Reviews: A book on my tbr since 2020. This book has such a special place in my heart. This is a book about a therapist, her personal life, importantly her professional life with her patients or clients and her therapist. I didn't know therapy could be this affordable in the form of a book. Each patient or client however you feel comfortable, is a tale about the struggle what made them choose therapy. Each tells a particular story about how they had gone through so much and how they're are trying to cope with it. So is the therapist whom they are going for therapy. The whole book is written how each of her patients finds themselves, accepting what has happened with them and moving on. When Lori herself finally realizes she even needs a therapy, and her journey with her therapist is so good. The way this book is written is something I can't explain, it's beyond words. The best thing I understood is that sometimes being there and listening to what someone has been through makes such huge difference we can never know. I urge you all to read this. Ps: we may never know till the end that this is also a kind of therapy and I cried a lot.</p>
